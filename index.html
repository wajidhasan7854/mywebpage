      <h1>💖 Thank You for Being My Friend 💖</h1>
      <p>Hey there! 🌸 I just wanted to say a huge THANK YOU for saying yes to being my friend! 🥹✨ 
      It honestly means so much to me. Knowing that you’re open to sharing laughs, memories, 
      and good vibes together makes my heart so happy 💫💞</p>

      <p>Friendship isn’t just about chatting every day — it’s about knowing that there’s someone 
      out there who truly gets you, supports you, and wants to grow alongside you 🌱🤗 
      I already feel lucky to have crossed paths with such a wonderful person like you! 💐</p>

      <p>I promise to be the kind of friend who listens, cheers you on, and stands by you 
      through every high and low 💪❤️ Life’s journey is always better with amazing people 
      beside us — and now, that includes YOU! 🌈💫</p>

      <p>So here’s to new memories, endless laughter, deep talks, and a friendship that keeps 
      shining brighter every day 🌟🥳 Thank you again for saying yes — it really means the 
      world to me! 💕</p>

      <p>With all my gratitude and good vibes,<br>Your new friend 😄💌💫</p>

      <h1>💔 Thank You Anyway 💔</h1>
      <p>Hey there 🌸 I just wanted to take a moment to say thank you — even though you said no 
      to being friends, I still truly appreciate your honesty and the time you took to respond 🙏💫 
      It takes courage to be clear and genuine, and I respect that deeply 💐</p>

      <p>Of course, I feel a little sad 😔 because I really thought we could share some good moments, 
      laughs, and kindness together 💭 But I completely understand that friendship is something 
      that can’t be forced — it has to come naturally 🌿 And that’s okay 💖</p>

      <p>I still wish you nothing but the best in everything you do 🌈✨ May your days be filled 
      with happiness, peace, and good people who make your heart smile 🦋 Even though we may 
      not be friends, I’ll always send good vibes your way and hope life treats you kindly 🌻💞</p>

      <p>Sometimes, even when things don’t go how we hoped, they still teach us something beautiful — 
      about patience, understanding, and gratitude 💫 So, thank you for being honest, and for 
      reminding me that every answer — even a “no” — can come with kindness and respect 💌</p>

      <p>Wishing you all the love, luck, and light in the world 🌟💖</p>
      <p>With appreciation and a gentle smile,<br>Someone who still wishes you well 😊💫🌸</p>
